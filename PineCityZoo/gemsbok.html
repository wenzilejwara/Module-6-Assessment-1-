                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope
        in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such 
        as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.
        The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current
        population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
                           
     <p>Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both genders have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden</p>
   <p>The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required (3 liters per 100 kg bodyweight and day)</p>
